    <br>Shall I compare Thee to a summers day<br>Thou art more lovely and more temperate<br>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May<br>And summer's lease hath all too short a date<br>Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines<br>And oft is its gold complexion dimmed<br>and every fair from fair sometimes declines<br>By chance or natures changing course untrimmed<br>
